    "## Description\n",
    "We are investigatig a Kickstarter datatset that includes properties of Kickstarter campaigns starting from December 2016 until Janurary 2018. The dataset includes 378,000 projects.  The dataset includes the following key properties: \n",
    "    date the campaign was launched\n",
    "    the type of project\n",
    "    which country it was launch from\n",
    "    goal amount\n",
    "    number of backers\n",
    "    successful funding states\n",
    "    date of campaign closing\n",
    "    total amount pledged\n",
    "    \n",
    "We are looking for patterns of successfully funded projects among different projects. We want to see what characteristics of a project can help create high likelihood of being funded.\n",
    "## Importance of Problem\n",
    "Kickstarter is becoming an increasingly populat platform for startups. For new companies that cannot find or do not want Venture Capital funding or debt, Kickstarter provides an alternative for raising funds. Kickstarter helped kickoff a new era of \"Crowdfunding\", and continues to be the most popular crowdfunding platform for entrenpurs. We wanted to examine this dataset, because we want to help entrepenurs fund thier new company or product. A Kickstarter campaign takes a lot of time and money, and increasing numbers of people are turning to Kickstarter for funding. Therefore, if a company could know predict if their project would be successful or not before creating a campaign, they could find a better way of fundraising. "

    "## KNN\n",
    "Our problem, is a classification problem. We want to use certain features of a Kickstarter Campaign to determine if the campagin was successful or not. We first had to clean the data and convert the columns into proper datetime objects. We then got our baseline for the dataset, which is 63.55% for only picking that a project will not get funding.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset there is a feature titled \"state\", which says the status of the project. There are six possible states, but we are only concerned with four of them: successful, failed, canceled, and suspended. Our first approach was to use a k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNN) classifer to make predictions. In our approach we created a new target column and assigned a binary value. 1.0 was assigned for successful projects, and 0.0 was assinged for the other three states. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our first attempt we chose two features: number of backers and target goal converted to USD according to the date of the project launch. We used cross-validation to determine the optimal number of nearest-neighbors. Surpringly, the number of nearest-neighbors for numbers under 100 has about the same accuracy. It ranged from 91% to 93% accurate. Increasing the number of nearest neighbors more than 100 say decreased accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "(graph) Although we had really high accuracy with this kNN classifer, analyzing the model shows it is not the best option. We originally thought knowing the how many backers you need compared to your goal would help you determine how to run your project. Looking at the graph, you can see that there are two clusters of projects. Those with high backers and lower goals that succeeded, and those with little backers and higher goals that failed. This classifer is fairly intuitive and relies on data from after the project has finished. Since we want to help future Kickstarter projects. We felt that we could do better using data before the project is launched."

    "## Naive Bayes\n",
    "Since most of the data seems independent and categorical, the Naive-Bayes classifer seemed like a better choice. There is a correlation between category/main category and goal (figure), with different categories having higher average goals. However, there is a wide spread of goals in each category and therefore it is hard to true determine how dependent the variables are. \n",

The three bins for the length are less than 29 days, between 29 and 31 days, and over 31 days. With most of the data between 29 and 31 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Naive Bayes model we were able to get 68.92% accuracy. This is only slighty higher than the baseline of 63.55%. The class priors are slightly different than the baseline we predicted but not too much. Looking at the feature importance gives us further insight to what makes a Kickstarter project successful. 9 out of the 10 top important features are categories, and 4 of the featuers belong to the main category of technology. The only other non-category feature is the goal binned. This shows that the projects with reasonable funding goals get are important in this model for project successfulness. "
